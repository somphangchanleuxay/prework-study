# Prework Study Guide Page

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The development of this webpage  was suggested to help me gain a understanding of HTML, JavaScript, CSS. Downloading programs that are used in the real world of developers. 
- This website was made initially as a homework assignment, but more so was to help get my foot into the coding/programming realm. 
- Breaks the barrier of not knowing anything from progamming to understanding a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- I learned that the frame of HTML is initially the start of web development, CSS is more so the flavor when it comes to stylizing and organizing the page, Java is the interaction that takes place for the USER within the webpage, along side with implementing arrays, functions, if and for statements inside of Java and the aspects of that.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
